## Unhandled Asynchronous Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js asynchronous programming where an error thrown within an asynchronous operation in an Express.js route handler is not properly caught, leading to unexpected server crashes.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where the `someAsynchronousOperation` function might throw an error.  The error isn't caught leading to a crash.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution using `try...catch` to gracefully handle the error.

This is a crucial example to understand the importance of robust error handling, especially in asynchronous operations within Node.js applications.  Failure to handle these errors can result in application instability and data loss.
